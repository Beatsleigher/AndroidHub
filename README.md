# AndroidHub

AndroidHub is a set of multiple applications and libraries, working together to work on Windows systems.
The goal of AndroidHub is to provide a sleek design, with powerful features, that make managing your Android device a pleasure!

# What can it do?
AndroidHub is designed to work well with your Android device, regardless of its manufacturer. 
It will work with one or more devices at a time and will constantly measure your device's health.
AndroidHub includes the functionality to backup and restore your device to prevent damage and more.
AndroidHub works with the fastest libraries and thanks to its asynchronious and multithreading capabilities, it works lightning fast!
AndroidHub also provides more basic functionality, like a file browser for your device(s), an activity, package and application manager and more!
There are also features for all power users: Looking for a quick console with more command than you need? Look no further, 
due to the fact that AndroidHub is written purely using Microsoft's .Net framework, you can harness almost the entire power 
of your Windows PC!
Looking to create a JSON file containing all the applications on your device for use, for example, on a website? It's all in AndroidHub.

Be sure to give AndroidHub a crack and test it for yourself!
